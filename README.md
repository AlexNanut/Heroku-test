# Overview

## The Challenge:

Create an application that uses Express.js on the back end by saving and retrieving note data from a JSON file. Once done, merge connect both the back end and front end of the application then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

## User Story


* AS A small business owner
* I WANT to be able to write and save notes
* SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete


## Acceptance Criteria


* GIVEN a note-taking application
* WHEN I open the Note Taker
* THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
* WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
* THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
* WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
* THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
* WHEN I click on the Save icon
* THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
* WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
* THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
* WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
* THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

## Built With
- JSON
- Heroku
- Dynamic JavaScript

## What I Learned
- I learned how to use the HTTP methods to create api routes and html routes.
- I learned direct deployment to Heroku from the intergrated terminal command line interface.

### Continued Development:
1. Learn more Express development.
2. Build more complex and robust web applications in the future.
